Brown Onions (Note 1)
2 Onions Large
1/2 cup Vegetable Oil
Chicken Marinade:
700 grams Chicken Thighs and Drumsticks bone-in and skinless (Note 2)
3/4 cup Yogurt or hung curd
1/4 cup Tomato Puree
1/4 cup Vegetable Oil
1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste minced ginger and garlic
1 tablespoon Red Chilli Powder sub with 1 teaspoon Paprika + 1 teaspoon Cayenne
1 teaspoon Turmeric Powder
1 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder
2 tablespoon Brown Onions
1 1/4 teaspoon Salt
Saffron:
2 tablespoon Hot Milk
10-15 Saffron strands
Parboiled Rice (70% cooked):
2 cups Basmati Rice Note 3
6 cups Water
2 tablespoon Salt
1 Bayleaf
5-6 Cloves
2-3 Cardamom Pods
Other Biryani Ingredients:
1 cup Mint Leaves fresh
1 cup Coriander Leaves Cilantro
1 1/2 tablespoons Ghee or Butter
To Serve:
Crispy Brown Onions
Onion Raita
###
1. To make the brown onions, pat the onions dry and if time permits, leave them out on a kitchen towel for 15-20 minutes to dry them out slightly. Heat oil in a pan and add the onions. On a medium flame, shallow fry the onions for 15 minutes till they are a deep golden brown, without burning them. Drain them out on a paper towel, and set aside. These can be made ahead and stored in an air tight container overnight. Burnt onions will add a bitter flavor to the biryani. You can also use store bought fried onions/ shallots which are easily available in leading supermarkets, Indian and Asian stores.

2. Mix together all the ingredients under chicken marinade and marinate for at least two hours or overnight for best results.
When you are ready to make the biryani, soak saffron strands in hot milk and rub them slightly with the back of a spoon. Set this aside.
Bring water to a roaring boil and add salt, whole spices and basmati rice. Cook for exactly 5 minutes and drain completely, leaving the whole spices in the rice. This will cook the rice to about 70% doneness which can be checked by pressing a grain of rice between two fingers - the rice should still be raw in the middle.

3. Layering and Cooking Chicken Biryani: 
Heat a heavy bottomed pot like a dutch oven, and add the chicken to it. Cook for 4 minutes and then turn the chicken pieces once. Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Scatter half the onions all over the chicken, and then all the coriander and mint leaves. Next layer the rice all over the mint and coriander, and in the end drizzle saffron milk and ghee all over the rice. Cover and cook on a low flame for 20 minutes - this will help steam the rice, cook it to doneness and cook the chicken. (Note 4)
4. Once the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 5 minutes, and finish by scattering the remaining onions on top. Serve hot with your

To Prepare The Ramen Egg:
1. Whisk together the 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of rice vinegar and 3/4 cup water, set aside.
2. Prepare an ice bath by filling a bowl with ice and water.
3. Bring a pot of water to boil (make sure there is enough water to cover the eggs). When boiling, carefully lower the eggs into the water using a slotted spoon or spider. Reduce heat if necessary to keep the water just barely boiling. Cook for 7 minutes, then remove from pot and place eggs in the ice bath. Leave in the ice bath for 3 minutes. Remove from ice bath and gently peel (egg will be soft). Place peeled eggs in the marinade and make sure they are completely covered with the marinade. Leave in the marinade for several hours or overnight. If keeping longer, discard the marinade and store in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat the egg in the ramen broth (don't leave in the broth very long before serving or the egg will overcook).

3. (If using another type of noodle, follow package instructions)
To Prepare The Soup:
1. Heat a large pot or dutch oven over medium high heat. Add the onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and saute for another 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and stir fry for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant so that they don't burn. Add the chicken broth and 1 cup of water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, oyster sauce, fish sauce, chili garlic sauce, stir to combine. Bring back to a simmer.
2. When broth reaches a simmer, add the chicken thighs. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until chicken is cooked through and reaches a temperature of 165Â°F.
3. Remove the chicken and shred it with two forks. Add it back to the broth along with the bok choy and cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and serve.
To Serve The Ramen:
1. In a bowl, place a serving of noodles, then pour the soup over them. Top soup with ramen egg, sliced green onions, cilantro and sesame seeds if desired.

1/4 cup rice 50 grams
1 teaspoon ghee also known as clarified butter
3-4 green cardamom pods slightly crushed
1 liter whole milk
4-5 tablespoons sugar 50-62.5 grams, adjust to taste
3 tablespoons chopped nuts I used chopped cashews & almonds
1.5 teaspoons rose water optional
###
1. Rinse the rice until water turns clear. Then soak the rice in enough water for 20 to 30 minutes. Once 30 minutes are up, drain the rice using a colander and set aside. 
2. Heat a heavy bottom pan on medium heat. Then add 1 teaspoon of ghee to it and then add the soaked & drained rice. Also add 3-4 crushed green cardamom pods.
3. Toss the rice with the ghee and cardamom for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring constantly until aromatic.
4. Then add the milk to the pan and stir well. Set heat to medium-high.
5. Let the milk come to a boil, this will take around 10-12 minutes. Stir in between so that milk doesn't stuck to the bottom of the pan.
6. Once the milk has come to a boil, lower the heat to low and let the kheer cook for around 25 minutes on low heat. Stir every 2 minutes or so. The milk will reduce considerably after 25 minutes and the kheer would look thick and the rice will be completely cooked. If you want super thick kheer, cook for 15 more minutes at this point.
7. Add in the sugar and mix. Also add in the nuts. 
8. Cook the kheer for 5 more minutes after adding the sugar and nuts. The sugar should dissolve completely. Don't worry if your kheer doesn't look very thick at this point. It will continue to thicken as it cools down.
9. Remove pan from heat. Stir in rose water (if using). Garnish with more nuts and serve kheer warm or chilled. I love mine chilled and serve it after chilling it in the refrigerator for 4 to 5 hours.
